# no_dup_copier
Program to copy directory trees, maintaining tree structure but avoiding duplicate files (ie files with equal checksums)

## Requirements
This program was built using a pipenv environment on Windows 10.

Install pipenv!

From a command line run "pipenv install" to install the necessary runtime environment.

To run the program run pipenv run photo_organizer.py


### TODO Check for overlapping directories

### TODO Check for proper function on Windows and Unix
Uses python pathlib so it may be OK assuming pipenv is installed.
