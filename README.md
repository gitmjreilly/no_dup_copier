# no_dup_copier
Program to copy directory trees, maintaining tree structure but avoiding duplicate files (ie files with equal checksums)

## Requirements
This program was built using a pipenv environment on Windows 10.
Install pipenv!
With pipenv you can run "pipenv install" from a command line to get an 
environment with the necessary modules.


### TODO Check for overlapping directories

### TODO Check for proper function on Windows and Unix
Uses python pathlib so it may be OK assuming pipenv is installed.
